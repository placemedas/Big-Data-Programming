1. What happened to the HDFS file when one of the nodes it was stored on failed?

Answer:
When one of the nodes went down, the information present in that node was replicated to another active node. 
For example, the block ID information before failure was as below:

Block ID: 1073741825
Size: 16777216
Availability:
hdfs-datanode-2
hdfs-datanode-3

Post failure of node-3 the same block had information as below:
Block ID: 1073741825
Size: 16777216
Availability:
hdfs-datanode-1
hdfs-datanode-2

2. How did YARN/MapReduce/Spark behave when one of the compute nodes disappeared?

Answer:
When one of the nodes disappeared during execution, the Executors connected to that particular node(yarn-nodemanager-3) did stop.
Post the same, all the executors eventually stopped spark re-ran those tasks with new executors on available nodes.

3.Were there more things you'd like to try with this cluster, or anything you did try that you think should have been in this assignment?

Answer:
It will be good to see how checkpointing the operation would help when a node failure occurs in spark execution. This would help us to 
understand how fast spark restores the state and produces output in the event of a failure.
